        <h2 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Kampala Outer Beltway Project Objectives</h2>
        <p>The project objectives include but are not limited to the following:</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">National Level</h4>
        <p>To promote equal access to economic and social development opportunities across the country; reduce traffic congestion within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area and thus reduce travel time; create inter-linkages of the major road corridors of Masaka, Mukono, Matugga, Mityana, Gayaza, Entebbe, as well as over the lake at Munyonyo as a ring road on the outskirts of Kampala City. Additionally, to serve as part of a wider programme to reduce transportation constraints along the northern corridor route for both national and regional traffic.</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Local Level</h4>
        <p>To improve access to goods/passenger transport services and reduce transport costs along the route; improve access to social and economic development opportunities along the route by providing high-capacity infrastructure; ensure no roadside communities become worse off as a result of the road construction works.</p>
    
        <h1 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Project Description</h1>
        <p>The Kampala Outer Beltway project is a proposed new dual carriageway expressway of 106 km around Kampala. The road will form an outer ring to the existing Kampala-Northern Bypass and will help facilitate smooth traffic flow between the outer nodes of the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area. It includes 19 grade-separated junctions (5 system interchanges and 14 access interchanges) as well as 32 simple crossing roads.</p>
    
        <p>The major intersections between the Project Expressway and the following ongoing or future main roads and expressways within the KOB Project area are:</p>
        <p>Kampala–Jinja Expressway, Southern Bypass, Kampala–Bombo Expressway, Kampala–Mpigi Expressway, Kampala–Entebbe Expressway, Kampala–Masaka road, Hoima Road, Mityana Road, Bombo Road, and Kampala–Jinja Road. It also features two major bridges crossing Lake Victoria at Ggaba, making it the first of its kind in Uganda.</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Project Location</h4>
        <p>The KOB Project Expressway is located in Kampala, Uganda. It traverses the districts of Wakiso and Mukono. The expressway starts at the Kampala-Entebbe Expressway, crosses predominantly rural areas with limited obstructions, and connects towns including Ggaba, Mukono, Seeta, Namugongo, Kiira, Kasangati, Mutugga, Wakiso, Buloba, and Nsangi. It terminates in Ggaba at a junction with the Kampala Southern Bypass.</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Project Benefits</h4>
        <p>A feasibility study was carried out for the KOB project, and the main benefits identified include:</p>
        <p>Distance-related Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) savings; optimum speed-related VOC savings; working and non-working travel time savings; reduction in passenger and freight transport costs; investment and job creation; improved access to schools, health centers, and other social facilities; and increased economic growth due to migration to the project community.</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Project Feasibility</h4>
        <p>Two routing alternatives were evaluated during the feasibility stage of the project, with the preferred option showing an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 41.3% and a Net Present Value (NPV)/Cost ratio of 1.497. This indicates that the benefits of implementing the KOB project far outweigh the costs, making it feasible.</p>
    
        <h4 style="color:#bb0a0a;">Stakeholders</h4>
        <p>The KOB project will impact the Ugandan people, making them the key stakeholders. The following are additional identified specific stakeholders:</p>
        <p>National Environment Management Authority (NEMA); Resources Management Directorate (WRMD) in Ministry of Water & Environment; Department of Geology and Mines; Occupational Health & Safety Department; Ministry of Gender, Labour & Social Development; National Roads Authority (UNRA); National Forestry Authority (NFA); Uganda Aids Commission (UAC); Wildlife Authority (UWA); Wakiso and Mukono District Authorities and Technical Teams; Council Leaders (LC I) along the proposed road project; and communities along the entire project road.</p>
