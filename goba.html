            <p>Review of the detailed engineering design and construction supervision of the rehabilitation of a portion of Road EN-2 between Impaputo and Goba.</p>
            <p>The project was divided into three different sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Section 1:</strong> 20 km in flat terrain, from the locality of Impaputo up to the Rio Umbeluzi, near Goba town.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 2:</strong> 2 km consisting of a bridge crossing the Umbeluzi river (360 m) and the road approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Section 3:</strong> 8 km of mountainous terrain from the town of Goba up to the border with Swaziland.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong style="color:#bb0a0a;">Detailed Description of Actual Services Provided by Your Company:</strong></p>
           
    
            <p>The work of the consultant was particularly challenging because the design and construction started simultaneously, requiring fast results. Aerial photography surveys were conducted to facilitate highway design, study catchment areas, dimension smaller bridges, and improve the Umbeluzi river crossing.</p>
