        <ul>
            <li>Site Investigations and laboratory tests for defining the parameters required for the geotechnical characterization of the soils in the pipeline route, boreholes with continuous soil recovery. Identification tests (particle size analysis, consistency limits on the soil fraction passing the sieve) were carried out on samples.</li>
            <li>Geotechnical characterization of the foundation soils on the basis of the results of all site investigations and laboratory tests.</li>
            <li>Geotechnical survey for the Early Production Scheme and Power Plant area for defining the parameters required for the geotechnical characterization of the foundation soils of the stations, boreholes with continuous soil recovery were carried out.</li>
            <li>Geo-electrical surveys covering soil resistivity survey, anode station selection, and cathodic protection design for the proposed oil pipeline using the Wenner Method, including area of Stations/Anode Stations.</li>
