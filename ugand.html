        <p>The National Road Data Collection & MIS involved the collection of visual inventory and condition data on all National Roads. A ROMDAS survey was conducted to gather accurate GPS data for the centerlines. GIS software was used to correlate and ensure quality assurance of the datasets, which were then entered into a Management Information System (MIS). The system, which is embedded with GIS, was installed on an ArcGIS server. The project also integrated various management systems related to road infrastructure planning. The system is currently being configured and will be installed by Aurecon.</p>
