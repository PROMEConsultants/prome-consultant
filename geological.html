            At PROME, we provide a complete service from materials sampling, in-situ testing and analysis through to the preparation of Interpretative Reports. Our team of engineers carries out desk studies, plans and designs ground investigations, and produces Geotechnical Interpretative Reports. We have experience across various projects, including buildings, roads and bridges, oil and gas facilities, hydropower projects, and wastewater treatment facilities.

            The effects of ground behavior on the built and natural environment can be far-reaching. Our geotechnical department has conducted extensive work, developing an enriched GIS database of ground investigations in the region, which we can use during the planning stages of projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To complement this, PROME Consultants offers geotechnical advice services from project inception through to construction. We also provide expert witness services, advising clients during legal proceedings when failures or distress to structures are suspected to arise from geotechnical issues. Additionally, we offer numerical modeling for complex structures, which helps to fully understand the forces on these structuresâ€”something that regular design tools may not be able to achieve effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a strong technical background, PROME is committed to delivering sustainable value engineering. We focus on understanding and addressing site abnormalities to realize the full potential of the site, deliver time savings, and achieve significant savings on the final build cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our geotechnics department places our engineers in a prime position to fully understand the ground behavior of soils and rocks, a position that benefits our clients and ensures the best possible outcomes.
