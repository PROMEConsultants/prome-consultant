       <p>TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERING SURVEYSM</p>
           <p> A thorough Topographic Survey is vital for the success of any Engineering project. PROME Consultants Ltd operates a stand-alone topographical and cadastral Unit that is part of the Built Environment and Engineering Division.</p>
            This unit is equipped with a number of experienced surveyors who provide accurate survey data using state of the art techniques that enables them produce quality work in a timely and cost effective manner. These Techniques include:
            Control Surveys using Global Positioning Systems (GPS): Used to determine precise Northings and Eastings on the ground surface (horizontal controls) and Digital and Automatic Levels to establish heights of points above mean sea level (Vertical Heights). Volumetric / Quantity Surveys (Cut and Fill): <p>These are used to determine volumes of land excavated and materials filled on construction projects handled. Terrestrial LiDAR: This is done using a 3D Laser Scanner for 3D modelling, this method provides a faster, safe and accurate method of collecting large amounts of data and producing Point clouds with different hues for visualization and 3D CAD plans.</p>
             Drone Surveys: This method also provides a faster, safer and accurate method of collecting data for production of Photo mosaics which can be used to produces DEMs, DTMs, Contours at varying intervals and Ortho- rectification of imagery.</p>

             <p>CADASTRAL SURVEYS</p>
                <p>Cadastral surveys deal with property boundaries and PROME Consultants Ltd follows the Laws and Regulations promulgated both on a national level and internationally in execution of Cadastral Surveys.</p>
                 <p>These regulations define ownership, land rights and expropriation procedures. Using state of the art equipment, the PROME surveyors determine individual property boundaries for sub- division, titling, legal issues and land acquisition on large road projects  and boundary demarcation.</p>
